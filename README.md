# Lost-in-Transit-The-PalletSense-Challenge
DecodeX Hackathon -N. L. Dalmia Institute of Management Studies and Research

Developed an intelligent pallet tracking solution for DecodeX Hackathon using geospatial analysis and machine learning (Isolation Forest) to detect off-route movements and stationary pallets with limited GPS pings. Enhanced supply chain visibility by integrating route adherence models and anomaly detection, improving tracking accuracy without increasing sensor frequency.
